Ava is the lab manager for the Reilly lab. Her work focuses on the functional characterization of positively selected human variants, more specifically those within genetic regulatory elements and linked to disease traits. Prior to her position in the lab, Ava completed her undergraduate studies at Wellesley College, where she wrote an honors thesis in Dr. Andrea Sequeiraâ€™s lab on the transcriptomic responses and adaptations of an invasive insect on various novel host plants. Her research interests seek to incorporate evolutionary concepts with cutting-edge functional genomics methods to understand organismal adaptation and variation.

In the fall of 2022, Ava will begin a Ph.D. in Duke's University Program in Genetics and Genomics (UPGG), funded by a James B. Duke Fellowship and the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. Outside of the lab, she enjoys ventures in horticulture, standup comedy, and hiking with her dog Bunsen.
