Ava completed her undergraduate studies at Wellesley College, where she wrote an honors thesis in Dr. Andrea Sequeiraâ€™s lab on the transcriptomic responses and adaptation in an invasive insect. After leaving Wellesley, she moved to Pardis Sabeti's lab at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT under the mentorship of then-postdoc Steve Reilly. Ava then became the lab manager for the newly minted Reilly lab as it opened its doors at Yale in the fall of 2021. Her work under Steve focused on the functional characterization of positively selected human variants, especially those within genetic regulatory elements, as well as consciously building the framework for an inclusive lab environment as the Reilly lab's first member.

In the fall of 2022, Ava has begun a Ph.D. in Duke's University Program in Genetics and Genomics (UPGG), funded by a James B. Duke Fellowship and the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. Her research interests seek to incorporate evolutionary concepts with cutting-edge functional genomics methods to understand organismal adaptation and variation. Outside of the lab, she enjoys ventures in horticulture, watching standup comedy, learning to rollerblade, and hiking or backpacking.
