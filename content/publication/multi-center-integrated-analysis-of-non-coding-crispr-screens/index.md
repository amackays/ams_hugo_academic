abstract: The ENCODE Consortium’s efforts to annotate non-coding, cis-regulatory
  elements (CREs) have advanced our understanding of gene regulatory landscapes
  which play a major role in health and disease. Pooled, noncoding CRISPR
  screens are a promising approach for systematically investigating gene
  regulatory mechanisms. Here, the ENCODE Functional Characterization Centers
  report 109 screens comprising 346,970 individual perturbations across 13.3Mb
  of the genome, using a variety of methods, readouts, and statistical analyses.
  Across 332 functionally confirmed CRE-gene links, we identify principles for
  screening endogenous, non-coding elements for causal regulatory mechanisms.
  Nearly all CREs show strong evidence of open chromatin, and targeting
  accessibility peak summits is a critical component of our proposed sgRNA
  design rules. We provide experimental guidelines to accurately detect CREs
  with variable, often low, transcriptional effects. We discover a previously
  undescribed DNA strand-bias for CRISPRi in transcribed regions with
  implications for screen design and analysis. Benchmarking five screen analysis
  tools, we find CASA produces the most conservative CRE calls and is robust to
  artifacts of low-specificity sgRNAs. Together, we provide an accessible data
  resource, predesigned sgRNAs targeting 3,275,697 ENCODE SCREEN candidate CREs,
  and screening guidelines to accelerate functional characterization of the
  noncoding genome.
